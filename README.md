# Elementary-ray-tracer
This is a basic ray tracer written in C, it renders combinations of spheres, planes cylinders and cones in space from input file.

This project was done in collaboration with Liam Dehaudt at 42.

## Features
* Renders basic forms (spheres, planes cylinders and cones) in any position and orientation
* Camera angle and position
* Multiple light sources
* Shine mode
* Multiple colored light mode
* Move and Turn camera with arrow keys (move) and ASDW (turn)

## Compiling and running
Run `make`. An executable will compile. Currently only tested on OS X.

Run with `./rtv1 "Filename"`.
A collection of sample files is included in `scenes/` folder.
